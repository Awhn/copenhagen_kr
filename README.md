# The Copenhagen Book

The Copenhagen Book provides a general guideline on implementing auth in web applications. It is free, open source, and community driven. It may be opinionated or incomplete at times but we hope this fills a certain void in online resources. We recommend using this alongside the [OWASP Cheat Sheet series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html).

If you have any suggestions or concerns, consider opening a new issue.
